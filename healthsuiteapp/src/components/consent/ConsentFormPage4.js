          This study uses a randomized controlled design. This means that you will be randomly (similar to flipping a coin) put into one of two groups using a 1:1 ratio. For every one person put into the treatment group, one person will be put into a waitlist control group. The treatment group will receive access to the Health enSuite Caregivers app, and the other group will be assigned to a waiting list. Those on the waiting list will be able to access Health enSuite Caregivers after the study is over. It is important that you understand that you might be assigned to either group, and that you cannot choose the group that you want.

          Our goal is to recruit a total of 400 adults who are caregivers caring for a person with moderate dementia from across Canada. Half of them will be assigned to the Health enSuite group and half of them will be assigned to the waiting list group. We will measure caregiverâ€™s well-being several times over the course of 6 months to see if there are any differences between the groups. We are interested in whether people who received Health enSuite Caregivers tend to do better over time than people who received their usual care.
